## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- tailwindcss
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

* Using tailwindcss to style a website
* Using custom styles with tailwindcss
* organizing my project-file structure

### Continued development

I am planning on using an animation-library like Framer-motion or GSAP for micro-interactions and animating elements whithin tailwindcss to make even more attractive websites and web apps

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCss Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me to figure out utility-classes that I had no idea what they were and what they were used for.
